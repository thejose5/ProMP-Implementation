# ProMP-Implementation
## Project Description
This project implements an Interaction Probabilistic Movement Primitive as introduced by Maeda, et al. in the following paper:
Maeda, Guilherme, et al. "Phase estimation for fast action recognition and trajectory generation in humanâ€“robot collaboration." The International Journal of Robotics Research 36.13-14 (2017): 1579-1594.

The goal of the algorithm is to train a robot on a specific task through multiple demonstrations and have it generalize the training demonstrations in order to collaborate with a human seamlessly.

In the test case used to validate this implementation, the robot writes the letter B when the human writes the letter A.
